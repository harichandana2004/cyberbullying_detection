# Cyberbullying Detection
This project implements a Cyberbullying Detection System that uses models like RNN,LSTM to classify comments as either cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying. The system takes preprocessed text data as input and predicts whether a given comment is harmful or not.
Using Python libraries such as PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and Google’s YouTube Data API, we can efficiently gather comments from specific posts or videos.
